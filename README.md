# COM220-Final-App
# A Blood Alcohol Content Tracker app

This was a the final class project for our Mobile App Developement course.

The purpose of this app is to be a tool to help users to estimate whether their driving ability would be impaired due to alcohol consumption, as well as to assist in locating members of their party which should include a designated driver.

This app allows the user to push a button each time they have an alcoholic beverage, and will estimate the change in their Blood Alcohol Content based on that. It has the ability to send texts to contacts who you specify as part of your party. It can also be used to take selfies for a 'story' which you would be able to share with your friends had this been more than a school project (had servers associated with it).

The development cycle for this app was very quick, about two weeks. The app is of May finished, and no more work is planned for it.
